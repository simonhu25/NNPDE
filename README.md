# NNPDE

This is a culminiation of the research done during Summer 2018. This is an independent project where I explore the applications of neural networks for the purposes of solving ordinary and partial differential equations. 

## What does NNPDE stand for?

It stands for integrity, honor, and justice. Just kidding.
