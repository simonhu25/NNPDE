# NNPDE

This repository is a culmination of research done during Summer 2018. In this project, I explore the application of neural networks for the purposes of solving ordinary and partial differential equations, a problem which is computationally difficult by nature. Though ODEs will be discussed, PDEs are the main focus of my study. In this project, I explore the different improvements that can be made, in particular, how the theory of Sobolev spaces can be applied here. 

## What does NNPDE stand for?

It stands for integrity, honor, and justice. Just kidding. NNPDE stands for **N**eural **N**etworks for **P**artial **D**ifferential **E**quations. 

## Can I use your code?

Absolutely.

## Can I use results from your paper in my own research? 

Of course. Please remember to cite the paper.
